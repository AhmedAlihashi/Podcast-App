# React Native Podcasting App
<h3>React Native &amp; Firebase Podcast App</h3>
<p>the app as it stands currently represents a minimum viable product</p>
This app uses React Native as a client side solution with Google Firebase' Firestore & Database

<h2> Why use Firebase as a backend solution? </h2>
Firebase Database in conjunction with Firestore provides instantaneous data read & writes as well as live metrics. 
This circumvents the need for a developer to program an entire dashboard. Most notably, Firestore (Google Firebase storage service)
provides the most storage space per dollar among all backend services.
