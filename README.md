# Why use Firebase as a backend solution?
<p>Firebase Firestore (database) in conjunction with their Storage service provides instantaneous data read & writes as well as live metrics. This circumvents the need for a developer to program an entire dashboard. Most notably, Firestore (Google Firebase storage service)provides the most storage space per dollar among all backend services.</p>
